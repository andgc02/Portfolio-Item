### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
The best way to interpret user needs and implementing them would be through the use of user stories. User stories are gathered by the Product Owner for the team and the Product Backlog to be used as a reference point for how the program should work.
### How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I usually approach developing programs by thinking what would be the best way to complete it. If it's a larger, more complex program, then I will decide if I need to break the work up using agile processes. If the program is smaller or serves a simple purpose then I will jot what needs to be done and begin development.
### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member in software development needs to be able to communicate clearly. If someone can't communicate, then progress will stagnate. For example, if an issue arises or the team member can't complete a task but can't communicate the problem then that'll cause major issues for the rest of the team.
